# RetroOasis Development Roadmap

> **Honest progress snapshot (2026-03-26)**
>
> - The current working stack is **React + Vite desktop UI + Tauri v2 native shell + WebSocket lobby server + TCP relay + local HTTP launch API (`/api/launch`)**.
> - **Tauri native packaging is now scaffolded** (`apps/desktop/src-tauri/`) with six Rust IPC command handlers implemented. **A C++ IPC bridge into the melonDS core in `/src`, and a broader REST backend for catalog/save/presence data are still not complete.**
> - The lobby now triggers **local emulator launch requests** through the server, but **real per-game ROM discovery/selection and relay token handoff into emulator processes are still incomplete**.
> - Presence, activity, saves, and cloud flows have useful UI scaffolding, but the **live/server-backed versions remain future work unless explicitly marked “mock/dev/demo.”**
> - Phase 7 (Input & Couch-Friendliness) is now complete: `controller-detection.ts` (Gamepad API wrapper — hot-plug events, `detectGamepadType`, `getConnectedGamepads`), `slot-assignment.ts` (per-player gamepad ↔ slot mapping, `autoAssignSlots`, localStorage persistence), `preflight-validator.ts` (`validateInputConfig` — errors for missing/disconnected gamepads, warning for keyboard sharing). Default input profiles added for 7 new systems: Wii, Wii U, Genesis, Dreamcast, PSX, PS2, PSP (21 new profiles × 3 controller types). `InputProfileManager` now loads all 16 systems (48 default profiles). 32 new tests (172 desktop total).
> - Phase 6 (Social) Presence, Invites & Social Glue are now complete: `RecentPlayersStore` + `SqliteRecentPlayersStore` (track co-players, max 50 per user), `PlayerPrivacyStore` + `SqlitePlayerPrivacyStore` (showOnline/allowInvites/showActivity toggles), WS `send-invite` → `invite-received` with privacy guard, WS `set-privacy` → `privacy-updated`, REST `GET/DELETE /api/players/:id/recent`, REST `GET/PUT /api/players/:id/privacy`, recent-players tracked on game-start, FriendsPage updated with Incoming Invites, Recent Players, Invite buttons, and Privacy Settings panel. 23 new tests (790 total).

## Cross-Cutting Quality Work

**Goal:** Keep the current prototype honest, debuggable, and safe to extend while native packaging and deeper backend work are still in progress.

### Milestones
- [x] `docs/status/debug-pass.md` — targeted bug-fix pass across lobby/frontend/server flows
- [x] `docs/status/current-state-audit.md` — honest working-vs-mocked inventory
- [x] `docs/status/full-audit.md` — full product/code audit with gap analysis
- [x] Phase status notes for N64, saves, presence, and DS work
- [x] Desktop API smoke tests (`apps/desktop/src/lib/__tests__/api-client.test.ts`, 14 tests)
- [x] Workspace validation documented and re-verified after `npm install` (`npm run typecheck`, `npm run test -w @retro-oasis/desktop`)

- [ ] Native desktop verification checklist for Tauri / IPC flows
- [ ] Backend hardening: auth/identity, rate limiting, persistence, and deployable relay host configuration

## Current Carry-Over / Blockers

- [x] **Tauri native shell and IPC command surface for desktop-only capabilities**
  - `apps/desktop/src/lib/tauri-ipc.ts` defines the full typed command surface
    (`tauriScanRoms`, `tauriPickFile`, `tauriPickDirectory`, `tauriLaunchEmulator`)
    with HTTP-API fallbacks so the app runs in both native and browser/dev mode.
  - `apps/desktop/src-tauri/` scaffolded with Tauri v2: `Cargo.toml`, `tauri.conf.json`,
    `build.rs`, `src/main.rs`, `src/lib.rs`, `src/commands.rs`, `capabilities/default.json`.
  - Six Rust command handlers implemented: `scan_rom_directory`, `pick_file`,
    `pick_directory`, `launch_emulator`, `launch_local`, `check_file_exists`.
  - `@tauri-apps/api` and `@tauri-apps/cli` added to desktop workspace.
  - `npm run tauri:dev` / `npm run tauri:build` / `npm run build:tauri` wired into npm scripts.
  - 22 new tests in `tauri-ipc.test.ts` (392 desktop total).

- [ ] **C++ IPC bridge between the TypeScript launcher and the melonDS core in `/src`**
  - `apps/lobby-server/src/melonds-ipc.ts` defines the full `MelonDsIpcBridge`
    interface + protocol message types (`MelonDsCommand` / `MelonDsResponse`).
    A `MelonDsIpcStub` provides no-op responses for dev/test use.
  - Remaining: compile the C++ core via the existing CMake build, implement the
    Unix socket / named-pipe server in C++, replace the stub with a real socket
    client, wire the sidecar launch into Tauri or Node.js.

- [ ] **Backend expansion beyond WebSocket rooms + `/api/launch`**
  - Catalog endpoints (`GET /api/games`, `GET /api/games/:id`,
    `GET /api/games/search`, `GET /api/systems`) are now live on the lobby
    server, backed by `@retro-oasis/game-db`. `VITE_API_MODE=backend` is
    functional for catalog queries.
  - Remaining: auth/identity layer, rate limiting, save-sync endpoints, presence
    persistence, deployable relay-host configuration.

- [ ] **Real ROM ownership/discovery flow: filesystem scan, file association, and per-room ROM selection**
  - `GET /api/roms/scan?dir=<path>&recursive=<bool>` endpoint added to the lobby
    server (delegates to the existing `scanRomDirectory` scanner).
  - `apps/desktop/src/lib/rom-library.ts` added: per-game ROM file associations
    stored in localStorage (`setRomAssociation`, `getRomAssociation`,
    `resolveGameRomPath`).
  - `LobbyContext` now resolves the game-specific ROM path via
    `resolveGameRomPath(gameId)` instead of using the raw ROM directory.
  - Remaining: native file-picker UI in Settings / game detail page (requires
    Tauri `tauriPickFile`), visible association status per game in Library page,
    server-side ROM catalog persistence.

- [x] **Relay authentication handoff: feed per-player session tokens into launched emulator processes**
  - `LaunchOptions.sessionToken` added to `@retro-oasis/emulator-bridge`.
  - Token is injected as `RETRO_OASIS_SESSION_TOKEN` env var on the spawned
    emulator child process.
  - `/api/launch` now accepts and forwards `sessionToken`.
  - `LobbyContext` includes `sessionToken` in the `/api/launch` request body.

### Phase 26a — Bug Fixes

- [x] `activity-feed.ts` — Ring buffer eviction: replaced `O(n)` `slice(0, MAX_EVENTS)` allocation with `O(1)` `pop()` call; oldest entry is removed without re-allocating the full array
- [x] `ranking-store.ts` — Added explicit comment clarifying per-game draw semantics: `gamesPlayed` increments on draws; no separate wins/losses counter is mutated (consistent with `GameRank` interface and `game_rankings` schema)
- [x] `handler.ts` — `displayNameToPlayerId` cleanup on disconnect: removed `break` so **all** stale entries for the disconnected `playerId` are deleted (prevents ghost entries / memory leak)
- [x] `handler.ts` — `send-dm` handler: added 2 000-character maximum length guard; oversized messages return `{ type: 'error', message: 'Message too long (max 2000 characters)' }` instead of being stored
- [x] `index.ts` — `POST /api/messages/send`: wrapped `JSON.parse` in `try/catch`; malformed body now returns `400 { error: 'Invalid JSON body' }` instead of an unhandled crash
- [x] `index.ts` — `POST /api/messages/read`: same JSON parse guard added
- [x] `index.ts` — `POST /api/rankings/match`: same JSON parse guard added

### Phase 26b — UI Polish

- [x] `RetroAchievementsPage.tsx` — Added `loadError` state + `retryKey` counter; if any fetch throws, an error message with a **Retry** button is shown instead of the spinner hanging forever

### Phase 26c — Tests

- [x] 14 new unit tests in `phase-26.test.ts` — ring buffer eviction, draw outcome (global + per-game), GlobalChatStore ordering, NotificationStore unread count
- [x] `roadmap.md` updated with Phase 26 milestones

## Phase 27 — Nintendo Wii U Support & README Multi-Platform Update

BIOS file validation, a curated per-game netplay safety whitelist, and a named RetroArch
enhancement-preset library that clearly distinguishes netplay-safe from single-player-only configs.

### What was added

**New libraries**
- [x] `bios-validator.ts` — `BIOS_REQUIREMENTS` registry for `psx` (5 regional BIOS variants), `gba`, `nds` (bios7 + bios9 + firmware), and `dreamcast` (boot + flash). `systemRequiresBios()`, `getBiosRequirements()`, `validateBiosEntry()`, `validateAllBios()` helpers. All MD5 hashes are 32-char lowercase hex strings from community verification projects.
- [x] `netplay-whitelist.ts` — `NETPLAY_WHITELIST` of 38 entries across psx/nes/snes/gba/n64/genesis/sms/nds/psp, each rated `approved | caution | incompatible` with an honest reason. Helpers: `getNetplayEntry()`, `isNetplayApproved()`, `isNetplayIncompatible()`, `getNetplayWarning()`, `approvedGamesForSystem()`.
- [x] `retroarch-presets.ts` — 8 named presets (4 netplay-safe: `clean`, `performance`, `scanlines`, `lcd-grid`; 4 single-player: `crt-royale`, `runahead-1`, `rewind`, `accurate`). Each has a flat `settings` map of RetroArch `.cfg` key/value pairs, a `netplaySafe` flag, and an `onlineWarning` for unsafe presets. Helpers: `getPreset()`, `netplaySafePresets()`, `singlePlayerPresets()`, `getPresetOnlineWarning()`, `applyPreset()`.

**Updated**
- [x] `launch-preflight.ts` — new `biosPath` option; check 3 (`bios-configured` / `bios-missing`) added for systems where `systemRequiresBios()` returns `true` (psx, nds, dreamcast). GBA and NES are unaffected.

**Tests**
- [x] `apps/desktop/src/lib/__tests__/phase-37.test.ts` — 63 new tests:
  - BIOS registry shape (4 systems, MD5 format, required flags)
  - `systemRequiresBios()` — psx/nds/dreamcast true; gba/nes false; case-insensitive
  - `validateBiosEntry()` — hash match / mismatch / missing / unknown file / case-insensitive
  - `validateAllBios()` — bulk validation, unknown system, passing PSX map
  - Netplay whitelist catalog shape (≥ 30 entries, unique IDs, all systems represented)
  - `getNetplayEntry()`, `isNetplayApproved()`, `isNetplayIncompatible()`, `getNetplayWarning()`, `approvedGamesForSystem()`
  - RetroArch preset catalog (≥ 4 safe, ≥ 3 single-player; all non-safe have `onlineWarning`)
  - `getPreset()`, `getPresetOnlineWarning()`, `applyPreset()` (merge, unknown ID, no base)
  - Preflight BIOS integration — blocks psx/nds/dreamcast without biosPath, passes with it; nes/gba unaffected
- [x] Total: 336 desktop tests — all passing.
- [x] `roadmap.md` updated with Phase 37 milestones.

## Phase 39 — Debug & Polish Save System (Complete)

**Goal:** Fix latent correctness bugs in the save-backup pipeline and tighten the save-file
discovery utilities.

### What was fixed

- [x] **`SaveBackupStore.postSessionSync` stale metadata** — the in-memory store called
  `markAsLastKnownGood(id)` on the _stored_ record but then spread the stale _copy_ returned by
  `createBackup`.  The returned `Omit<SaveBackupRecord, 'data'>` now re-reads from the backing
  `Map` so that `isLastKnownGood: true` and `reason: 'last-known-good'` are correctly reflected
  on a clean exit.

- [x] **`SqliteSaveBackupStore.postSessionSync` same stale-metadata bug** — the SQLite variant
  had the identical issue; fixed by re-fetching via `this.get(b.id)` after the
  `markAsLastKnownGood` UPDATE so the returned metadata is sourced from the database row.

- [x] **`inferBackendFromExtension` missing `.vms` → `flycast` mapping** — `.vms` is the
  Dreamcast Virtual Memory Unit save format used exclusively by the flycast emulator, but it was
  absent from the inference table.  Added alongside `.gci` / `.raw` (dolphin) for consistent
  discovery of non-preferred backend saves.

- [x] **`SaveManager.importSave` incorrect extension extraction when directory path contains
  dots** — `externalPath.slice(externalPath.lastIndexOf('.'))` scanned the full path including
  parent directory names (e.g. `/home/user.name/saves/savefile` → ext `'.name/saves/savefile'`).
  Fixed to extract the filename component first and then look for a dot only inside the basename.

### Tests

- [x] `phase-4.test.ts` — 5 new assertions:
  - `SaveBackupStore`: `postSessionSync` returned metadata has `isLastKnownGood=true` and
    `reason='last-known-good'` when `cleanExit=true`
  - `SaveBackupStore`: returned metadata has `isLastKnownGood=false` / `reason='post-session'`
    when `cleanExit=false`
  - `SqliteSaveBackupStore`: same two assertions
  - `inferBackendFromExtension('.vms')` returns `'flycast'`
- [x] Corrected one stale assertion: the integration test for `session-end` now correctly expects
  `reason: 'last-known-good'` (not `'post-session'`) on a clean exit.
- [x] Total: 1643 tests — all passing.
- [x] `roadmap.md` updated with Phase 39 milestones.

## Phase 41 — PSX Overhaul ✅

### Deliverables

- [x] **6 new PSX mock games** (total ≥ 15): Crash Team Racing, Final Fantasy VII, Resident Evil 2,
  Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage, Gran Turismo 2, Diablo — each with `coverEmoji`, `tags`, `badges`, and `description`.
- [x] **6 new PSX session templates** (total 16): CTR (4P, 80 ms), FF7 (1P, 150 ms), RE2 (1P, 100 ms),
  Spyro 2 (1P, 100 ms), Gran Turismo 2 (2P, 80 ms), Diablo (1P, 100 ms).
- [x] **11 new PSX game-metadata entries** (total 13): Tekken 3, SF Alpha 3, THPS2, Twisted Metal 2,
  Crash Bash, Worms Armageddon, Crash Bandicoot, Metal Gear Solid, Final Fantasy VII, Gran Turismo 2,
  Diablo — each with `genre`, `developer`, `year`, `onboardingTips`, `netplayTips`, `artworkColor`.
- [x] **7 new PSX netplay-whitelist entries** (total 15): Crash Bandicoot (approved), THPS2 (approved),
  Crash Bash (approved, 4P), Worms Armageddon (approved, 4P), Twisted Metal 2 (caution),
  Gran Turismo 2 (caution), Diablo (caution).
- [x] **`mednafen-psx` backend** added to `KNOWN_BACKENDS` — Beetle PSX HW libretro core via RetroArch,
  cycle-accurate, hardware renderer PGXP, `supportsNetplay: true`.
- [x] **PSX adapter flags**: `pgxpEnabled` (`--pgxp`), `cdRomFastBoot` (`--fast-boot`),
  `multitapEnabled` (`--multitap`), `analogControllerEnabled` (`--analog`) — DuckStation only;
  `mednafen-psx` / `retroarch` routes through `buildRetroArchArgs`.
- [x] **`mednafen-psx` in PSX fallback backends** (`fallbackBackendIds: ['mednafen-psx', 'retroarch']`).
- [x] **PSXPage overhaul**: Guide tab (📖) with Emulator Backends, PSX Accessories, ROM Formats,
  BIOS Setup, Netplay Tips, Controller Setup sections; `MULTITAP_GAMES` / `ANALOG_REQUIRED_GAMES`
  sets with accessory badges; game list now sourced from `MOCK_GAMES` (auto-includes new titles);
  updated banner mentions DuckStation + Mednafen PSX + RetroArch.
- [x] **phase-22.test.ts** — two PSX template assertions updated to `≥ 16` / `latencyTarget > 0`
  to accommodate the overhaul.
