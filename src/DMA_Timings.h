// DMA timing tables
//
// DMA timings on the DS are normally straightforward, except in one case: when
// main RAM is involved.
// Main RAM to main RAM is the easy case: 16c/unit in 16bit mode, 18c/unit in 32bit
// mode.
// It gets more complicated when transferring from main RAM to somewhere else, or
// vice versa: main RAM supports burst accesses, but the rules dictating how long
// bursts can be are weird and inconsistent. Main RAM also supports parallel
// memory operations, to some extent.
// I haven't figured out the full logic behind it, let alone how to emulate it
// efficiently, so for now we will use these tables.
// A zero denotes the end of a burst pattern.
//
// Note: burst patterns only apply when the main RAM address is incrementing.
// A fixed or decrementing address results in nonsequential accesses.
//
// Note about GBA slot/wifi timings: these take into account the sequential timing
// setting. Timings are such that the nonseq setting only matters for the first
// access, and minor edge cases (like the last of a 0x20000-byte block).
