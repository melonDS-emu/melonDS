Slirp is free software; "free" as in you don't have to pay for it, and you
are free to do whatever you want with it.  I do not accept any donations,
monetary or otherwise, for Slirp.  Instead, I would ask you to pass this
potential donation to your favorite charity.  In fact, I encourage
*everyone* who finds Slirp useful to make a small donation to their
favorite charity (for example, GreenPeace).  This is not a requirement, but
a suggestion from someone who highly values the service they provide.

See LICENSE for the full copyright terms and conditions.

They basically mean you can do anything you want with the software, except
1) call it your own, and 2) claim warranty on it.  There is no warranty for
this software.  None.  Nada.  If you lose a million dollars while using
Slirp, that's your loss not mine.  So, ***USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!***.

If these conditions cannot be met due to legal restrictions (E.g. where it
is against the law to give out Software without warranty), you must cease
using the software and delete all copies you have.
