-- Info --

This archive contains source code and assembly for a custom BIOS replacement
for the Nintendo DS system. This code is in no way affiliated with Nintendo
and is not derived from Nintendo's BIOS implementation but has been implemented
using publically available documentation.

It can be assembled using the included Makefile along with a proper ARM gcc
toolchain. Change the first four lines to point to the proper toolchain of your
choice.
